# Diabetes-Prediction
"Diabetes Prediction" is a machine learning model developed to predict the risk of diabetes in females. This repository contains the code and resources used to train and evaluate the model, along with documentation on how to use it for diabetes risk assessment in female populations.

# Libraries used:
NumPy: For numerical computing.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as text preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
re: For regular expression operations.

# Usage :
Preprocess the data.
Data Analysis.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model using the training set.
Evaluate the model using the testing set.
